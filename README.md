# Running

`java -jar service/target/derpwizard-service.jar server service.json`


# Configuration

Refer to the Dropwizard configuration module for framework-specific configuration (logging, HTTP ports, etc.): http://www.dropwizard.io/manual/configuration.html

See `service.json` for an example configuration file suitable for a development environment.

See `service_local.json` for an example configuration file suitable for local development.

## Enabling SSL

Run `make_certs.sh` to generate a self-signed cert and keystore. It requires a configuration file (`selfsigned.cnf`) and a private key for encryption.

Refer to the Alexa documentation for how to create the configuration file:
